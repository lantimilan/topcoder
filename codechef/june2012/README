FLY must have a logical error, but where is it?

CLOEST can be improved, scored by number of neighbors found, now only has 1.

COOLNUM can use binary search for LC and UC, LC is between 10^n-1 to N, and UC
is between N+1 to 10^n. Each iteration advances 1 bit, need 1000*3=3000
iterations. Each iteration need to check possible 1,2,3 digit choice, this can
be done by checking all 000, 001, 002, ..., 999, for a total of 1000 choices. So
it runs in time. 
only the sum of digits matters.

MAXMATCH, N is only 5. So for each possible subset in left, find expected value
on the right. When N is 5, we only do this for the first 4, then the last one
can just use accumulated value. So the time is about 100^4=10^8.

POLYPAR, so many people ACed, but I have no idea what to do, except when deg=1,
you can trivially get answer since it is only c1 * sum.

HULL, didn't work much on it.
