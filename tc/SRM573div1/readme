failed 250 and cannot work out 450.
250 is when you do not have 3 elements.
450 cannot figure out each node only need altitude[0..n-1] as possible configuration.
One more mistake when doing 450 offline, start state can be (0, j) for j=0..n-1,
this is different from start at (0,0) and hope to reach all (0, j) because we need
altitude[0] >= altitude[j] for this move to be feasible.
